access and # is for protected access. Are all objects in Java references? this
is too java pilled, there's a reference variable and primitive vars so tragic.

Final object which is mutable, final just indicates we cannot override the
behavior but the data may still be mutable, i.e. `StringBuilder` vs `String`
this class is too Java pilled.
